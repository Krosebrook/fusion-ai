**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started** - Critical P0 Document  
**Priority:** P0 - Blocks Production  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Owner:** [Unassigned]

## Purpose

This document will provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting guidance for FlashFusion, including:

- Critical metrics catalog (error rate, latency, throughput, resource utilization)
- Alert definitions and thresholds (when to page, when to notify)
- Dashboard setup instructions (Datadog, Grafana, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Log aggregation setup (CloudWatch Logs, Elastic, etc.)
- On-call escalation policy
- SLI/SLO definitions (Service Level Indicators/Objectives)

## Why This Document is Critical

Without monitoring and alerting documentation:
- **Silent Failures** will go undetected
- **Performance Degradation** will affect users before team notices
- **Incident Response** will be slow due to lack of visibility
- **Capacity Planning** will be impossible
- **SLA Compliance** cannot be verified
