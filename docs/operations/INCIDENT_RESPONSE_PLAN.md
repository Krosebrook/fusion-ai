# [Incident Response Plan - Not Started]

**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started** - Critical P0 Document  
**Priority:** P0 - Blocks Production  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Owner:** [Unassigned]  
**Target Completion:** [Not Set]

---

## Purpose

This document will provide comprehensive incident response procedures for FlashFusion, including:

- Incident severity classification (P0-P4)
- Incident response roles (Incident Commander, Communications Lead, Operations Lead)
- Communication templates (internal team, customer-facing status updates)
- Escalation paths and on-call rotations
- Postmortem template and review process
- Common incident runbooks (API down, database issues, integration failures)

## Why This Document is Critical

Without an incident response plan:
- **Incident Response** will be chaotic and uncoordinated
- **Communication** with customers will be delayed or absent
- **Escalation** will be ad-hoc, potentially to wrong people
- **Learning** from incidents won't be systematized
- **Repeat Incidents** will occur due to lack of postmortems
