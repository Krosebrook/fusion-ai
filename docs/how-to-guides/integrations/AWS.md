**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started** - Critical P1 Document

## Purpose

Complete AWS integration guide including:
- IAM user/role setup with minimum required permissions
- S3 bucket configuration for asset storage
- Lambda function deployment (if applicable)
- CloudWatch logging setup
- Secrets Manager integration
- Cost optimization strategies

## Why This Integration is Important

AWS is the most popular cloud deployment target for FlashFusion users. Without proper documentation:
- Users misconfigure IAM permissions (security risk)
- Storage costs become excessive (no lifecycle policies documented)
- Debugging is difficult (logging not properly configured)
- Deployment failures are common
